        1914 and 1921, the population inhabiting the region of Bessarabia witnessed,
        although from behind the frontline, the world conflagration, which was followed
        by major political changes that detached the region from the Russian Empire,
        then created the conditions for a short independence period, to finally attach
        the province to \u201cGreater Romania\u201d in 1918. The history of the city
        of Chi\u0219in\u0103u during this tumultuous time period is discussed \u2013
        for the first time \u2013 with a specific focus on its dynamics as a place
        in which two political systems, defined by the imperial and the national model,
        confronted each other while also coexisting in different settings. The authors
        are especially interested in the trajectories of individuals, communities,
        and institutions linked to the city. They reconstruct the way local actors
        acknowledged political changes, but also how they exercised agency and imposed
        their own agendas, frequently based on local, group, or personal needs. The
        case of Chi\u0219in\u0103u is relevant for\nthe understanding of the major
        impact of political transition(s) on the local level. It shows that there
        were various local actors, all of them being part and parcel of this transition,
        within which they had their own story to tell. Whereas for some political
        or social groups 1918 meant a new beginning, for others it was the time of
        political vacuum, from which certain dividends could be extracted.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.37710\/plural.v6i1_1","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,16]],"date-time":"2020-04-16T01:09:12Z","timestamp":1586999352000},"page":"5-42","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Svetlana
