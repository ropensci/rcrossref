R interface to various CrossRef APIs
====================================


## CrossRef documentation

* Crossref API: [https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc/blob/master/rest_api.md](https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc/blob/master/rest_api.md)
* Crossref metadata search API (http://search.labs.crossref.org/)
* CrossRef [DOI Content Negotiation](http://citation.crosscite.org/docs.html)
* Text and Data Mining [TDM](http://tdmsupport.crossref.org/)

## Installation

Stable version from CRAN

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rcrossref")
```

Or development version from GitHub

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ropensci/rcrossref")
```

Load `rcrossref`

```{r}
library('rcrossref')
```

### Register for the Polite Pool

If you are intending to access Crossref regularly you will want to send your email address with your queries. This has the advantage that queries are placed in the polite pool of servers. Including your email address is good practice as described in the Crossref documentation under [Good manners](https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc). The second advantage is that Crossref can contact you if there is a problem with a query.

Details on how to register your email in a call can be found at `?rcrossref-package`. To pass your email address to Crossref, simply store it as an environment variable in .Renviron like this:

Open file: file.edit("~/.Renviron")

Add email address to be shared with Crossref crossref_email= "name@example.com"

Save the file and restart your R session

To stop sharing your email when using rcrossref simply delete it from your .Renviron file. 

## Citation search

Use CrossRef's [DOI Content Negotiation](http://citation.crosscite.org/docs.html) service, where you can citations back in various formats, including `apa`

```{r}
cr_cn(dois = "10.1126/science.169.3946.635", format = "text", style = "apa")
```

`bibtex`

```{r}
cat(cr_cn(dois = "10.1126/science.169.3946.635", format = "bibtex"))
```

`bibentry`

```{r}
cr_cn(dois = "10.6084/m9.figshare.97218", format = "bibentry")
```

## Citation count

Citation count, using OpenURL

```{r}
cr_citation_count(doi = "10.1371/journal.pone.0042793")
```

## Search Crossref metadata API

The following functions all use the [CrossRef API](https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc/blob/master/rest_api.md).

### Look up funder information

```{r}
cr_funders(query = "NSF")
```

### Check the DOI minting agency

```{r}
cr_agency(dois = '10.13039/100000001')
```

### Search works (i.e., articles)

```{r}
cr_works(filter = c(has_orcid = TRUE, from_pub_date = '2004-04-04'), limit = 1)
```

### Search journals

```{r}
cr_journals(issn = c('1803-2427','2326-4225'))
```

### Search license information

```{r}
cr_licenses(query = 'elsevier')
```

### Search based on DOI prefixes

```{r}
cr_prefixes(prefixes = c('10.1016','10.1371','10.1023','10.4176','10.1093'))
```

### Search CrossRef members

```{r}
cr_members(query = 'ecology', limit = 5)
```

### Get N random DOIs

`cr_r()` uses the function `cr_works()` internally.

```{r}
cr_r()
```

You can pass in the number of DOIs you want back (default is 10)

```{r}
cr_r(2)
```

## Get full text

Publishers can optionally provide links in the metadata they provide to Crossref for full text of the work, but that data is often missing. Find out more about it at [http://tdmsupport.crossref.org/](http://tdmsupport.crossref.org/).

Get some DOIs for articles that provide full text, and that have `CC-BY 3.0` licenses (i.e., more likely to actually be open)

```{r}
out <-
  cr_works(filter = list(has_full_text = TRUE,
    license_url = "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/"))
(dois <- out$data$doi)
```

From the output of `cr_works` we can get full text links if we know where to look:

```{r}
do.call("rbind", out$data$link)
```

From there, you can grab your full text, but because most links require
authentication, enter another package: `crminer`.

You'll need package `crminer` for the rest of the work.

Onc we have DOIs, get URLs to full text content

```{r eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("crminer")) {
  install.packages("crminer")
}
```

```{r}
library(crminer)
(links <- crm_links("10.1155/2014/128505"))
```

Then use those URLs to get full text

```{r eval=FALSE}
crm_pdf(links)
#> <document>/Users/sckott/Library/Caches/R/crminer/128505.pdf
#>   Pages: 1
#>   No. characters: 1565
#>   Created: 2014-09-15
```

See also [fulltext](https://github.com/ropensci/fulltext) for getting scholarly text 
for text mining.
