R Client for Various CrossRef APIs.
}
\section{Crossref APIs}{

rcrossref interacts with the main Crossref metadata search API at
\url{https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc/blob/master/rest_api.md},
the old metadata search API at \url{http://search.labs.crossref.org/}, their
DOI Content Negotiation service at
\url{http://citation.crosscite.org/docs.html}, and
the \emph{Text and Data Mining} project \url{http://tdmsupport.crossref.org/}
}

\section{Defunct}{

See \link{rcrossref-deprecated} and \link{rcrossref-defunct}
for details.

\section{What am I actually searching?}{

When you use the \code{cr_*()} functions in this package, you are using
the Crossref search API described at
\url{https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc/blob/master/rest_api.md}.
When you search with query terms, on Crossref servers they are not searching
full text, or even abstracts of articles, but only what is available in the
data that is returned to you. That is, they search article titles, authors,
etc. For some discussion on this, see
\url{https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc/issues/101}.
}

\section{Rate limiting}{

From time to time Crossref needs to impose rate limits to ensure that
the free API is usable by all. Any rate limits that are in effect will
be advertised in the \code{X-Rate-Limit-Limit} and
\code{X-Rate-Limit-Interval} HTTP headers.

This boils down to: they allow X number of requests per some time period.
The numbers can change so we can't give a rate limit that will always
be in effect. If you're curious pass in \code{verbose = TRUE} to
your function call, and you'll get headers that will display these rate
limits.
}

\section{Text mining}{

All Crossref specific text mining functions are now deprecated, and
moved to a new package \code{crminer}.

Another package \pkg{fulltext} is designed solely to do general purpose
text mining involving Crossref and other sources of scholarly metadata
and full text.
}

\section{High and Low Level APIs}{

For the Crossref search API (the functions \code{\link[=cr_funders]{cr_funders()}},
\code{\link[=cr_journals]{cr_journals()}}, \code{\link[=cr_licenses]{cr_licenses()}},
\code{\link[=cr_members]{cr_members()}}, \code{\link[=cr_prefixes]{cr_prefixes()}}, \code{\link[=cr_types]{cr_types()}},
\code{\link[=cr_works]{cr_works()}}), there is a high level API and a low level. The
high level is accessible through those functions just listed (e.g.,
\code{\link[=cr_works]{cr_works()}}), whereas the low level is accessible via the same
fxn name with an underscore (e.g., \code{\link[=cr_works_]{cr_works_()}}). The high level
API does data requests, and parses to data.frame's. Since the high level
API functions have been around a while, we didn't want to break their
behavior, so the low level API functions are separate, and only do the data
request, giving back json or a list, with no attempt to parse any further. The
low level API functions will be faster because there's much less parsing, and
therefore less prone to potential errors due to changes in the Crossref API
that could cause parsing errors. Note that cursor feature works with both
high and low level.

\section{RStudio Addin}{

On installation of \pkg{rcrossref} you get an RStudio Addin. To use the addin,
go to the top toolbar > Tools > Addins > Add Crossref Citations. You'll get a
window pop up that you can put in DOIs for. If the DOI is found, the bibtex
citations will be added to a file called \code{crossref.bib}. New citations
will be appended to that file. Addin authored by Hao Zhu

\section{Be nice and share your email with Crossref}{

The Crossref team encourage requests with appropriate contact information
and will forward you to a dedicated API cluster for improved performance when
you share your email address with them.
\url{https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc#good-manners--more-reliable-service}

To pass your email address to Crossref via this client, simply store it
as environment variable in \code{.Renviron} like this:
\enumerate{
\item Open file:
\code{file.edit("~/.Renviron")}
\item Add email address to be shared with Crossref
\code{crossref_email = name@example.com}
\item Save the file and restart your R session
}

Don't wanna share your email any longer? Simply delete it from
\code{~/.Renviron}
}
