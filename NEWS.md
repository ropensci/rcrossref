rcrossref 1.2.1
===============

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS
* Requests can now be cached (for a single session) with `cr_works`, `cr_abstract` and `cr_cn` by setting `cache = TRUE`


rcrossref 1.2.0
===============

* implement Crossref's REST API updates for the public and polite pool
* change of maintainer

rcrossref 1.1.0
===============

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* move `bibtex` package to Suggests as it has been orphaned, use it conditionally  (#209)
* change all uses of `tibble::tbl_df` to `tibble::as_tibble` (#206)
* additional fields now parsed in the `cr_works()` output: short-container-title, references-count, is-referenced-by-count, language, content-domain, and update-to (#208)


rcrossref 1.0.0
===============

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* docs page vignette has names (#197)
* `query.title` field query is no longer supported by Crossref, removed from package (#198)
* fix some links in readme (#199)
* improve documentation for how to do deep paging (new section "Deep paging"), and how to use the cursor specifically (#190)

### BUG FIXES

* fix error when progress used and when limit param not used  (#190)
* encoding fix for the Crossref RStudio Addin (#194) (#201)


rcrossref 0.9.2
===============

## NEW FEATURES

* `cr_funders()`, `cr_journals()`, `cr_licenses()`, `cr_members()`, `cr_prefixes()`, `cr_types()`, `cr_works()` gain ability to show a progress bar when using deep pagination when using `works=TRUE` (#186) (#188)

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* fix a test fixture that had non-ascii characters (#187)
* `cr_works()` returned a tibble in the `$data` slot in each case except for when a single DOI was passed to the `doi` parameter. now fixed  (#184) thanks @martinjhnhadley


rcrossref 0.9.0
===============

### NEW FEATURES

* big Crossref Addin update (#171) all work by @haozhu233
* Async HTTP introduced for `cr_works()`, `cr_works_()`, and `cr_citation_count()`. See the new parameter `async` (logical) in those functions. For `cr_citation_count()`, it now accepts more than 1 DOI, and the output has changed from a numeric value to a data.frame (columns: `doi` and `count`). With `async=TRUE` for `cr_works()` you get a list of data.frame's; while for `cr_works_()` you get a list of JSON's (#121) (#160) (#182)

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* package tests now using `vcr` for HTTP request/response caching (#178) (#179)
* in `works` data, now returning `published-print` and `published-online` fields (#181)
* add new filters for `/works` routes (when `works = TRUE`): `isbn`, `reference_visibility`, `has_content_domain`, and `has_domain_restriction` (#176) (#177)
* add new return element in `/works` routes (when `works = TRUE`): `$reference` gives the references cited in the article (these are not the articles citing the target article, sorry) (#176)
* improve documentation on the "polite pool". If you supply an email address Crossref will put you in the polite pool (#173) (#175) thanks @poldham
* added example to `cr_abstract()` of handling many DOIs while allowing for failures without stopping progress (#174) thanks @zackbatist

### BUG FIXES

* fix internal parsing of funder data in `cr_works()` (#180) thanks @nicholasmfraser for the bug report
* fix for `cr_citation_count()`: when given a bad/invalid/malformed DOI, throw warning and give back an `NA` (#164) thanks for the report @chreman
* Fix for instances in the package where we incorrectly were doing logical comparison's; detected via _R_CHECK_LENGTH_1_LOGIC2_


rcrossref 0.8.4
===============

### NEW FEATURES

* The RStudio Addin now includes ability to search by article metadata, e.g., title (#148) (#152) 
* you can now set a different base url for `cr_cn()`  (#168)

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* better behavior for `cr_cn()` when bibentry not valid, that is not parseable. before the package we use to parse `bibtex` would stop on invalid bibentry data, but now we get around the invalid bits and give back the bibentry (#147)
* updated and improved documentation for filters (#161)
* improved description of the `dois` parameter (#162) thanks @ms609
* Much improved error behavior for `cr_*` functions. We now give errors like `404 (client error): /works/blblbl - Resource not found.`, which includes HTTP status code, major class of error (success, redirect, client, server), the route requested, and the error message (#163) 

### BUG FIXES

* fixed bug in `cr_works()` in which field queries should have been possible for title and affiliation, but were not. Fixed now.  (#149)
* `cr_journals()` was not correctly parsing data when more than 1 ISSN given and `works` set to `TRUE`, fixed now (#156)
* `cr_journals()` was not correctly parsing data when no ISSN found and `works` set to `TRUE`, fixed now (#150)
* `cr_journals()` was not correctly handling queries with multiple ISSN's and `works` set to `FALSE`, fixed now (#151)
* fixed bug in `cr_works()`, and any other `cr_*` function that set `works=TRUE`. the `license` slot can have more than 1 result, and we were only giving the first back. fixed the parsing on this to give back all license results (#170)


rcrossref 0.8.0
===============

### NEW FEATURES

* Include documentation and internals to support passing a user 
supplied email to Crossref to get put into higher rate limit
pool (#145) thanks @njahn82
* Functions that operate on the `/works` route gain a `select`
parameter to select certain fields to return (#146)

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* Updated docs for additional options for the `sort` parameter (#142)
* Updated docs for additional options for doing field queries (the 
`flq` parameter) (#143)
* Filters: New filters added to the package, and some removed 
(e.g, `publisher-name`). You can see the filters with the 
functions `filter_details`/`filter_names`. Beware, some filters
error sometimes with the Crossref API - they may not work, but they may, let me know at <https://github.com/ropensci/rcrossref/issues> or let Crossref know at <https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc/issues> (#136) (#139) (#141)


rcrossref 0.7.0
===============

### NEW FEATURES

* All text mining functionality moved into a new package: `crminer`
<https://github.com/ropensci-archive/crminer> . Functions that did
text mining stuff now defunct, see `?rcrossref-defunct` (#122)
* All Crossref API requests now using `https` instead of `http` (#133)

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* replace `xml2::xml_find_one` with `xml2::xml_find_first` (#128)
thanks @njahn82
* replaced `httr` with `crul` for HTTP requests (#132)
* Now using markdown for documentation (#135)
* Added more documentation to `cr_journals` and `cr_works`
about what the returned data fields `backfile_dois` and `current_dois`
really mean (#105) thanks @SteveViss

### BUG FIXES

* Fix to `cr_prefixes` to not fail when no results found (#130)
thanks @globbestael
* Fixed `cr_works` to allow queries like `facet = license:*` to be
passed to `facet` parameter (was always allowed by Crossref, but we
neglected to allow it - previously only allowed a boolean) (#129)
* Fixed `cr_funders` and `cr_journals` to give back facet data along
with other data (#134)
* Fix to `cr_*` functions to check for a missing content-type
headers and instead of failing, we continue anyway and try to parse
data as sometimes Crossref doesn't give back a content type header
at all (#127)


rcrossref 0.6.0
===============

### NEW FEATURES

* Added support for field queries (see
<https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc/blob/master/rest_api.md#field-queries>
for information on them). Means that you can query on specific fields rather
than using `query` parameter which queries across all fields (#111)
* Now using `rappdirs` for local storage and caching for `cr_ft_text`  (#106)

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* Added to man files where appropriate new 10K max value for the
`offset` parameter (#126)
* Added to pkg level man file new rate limit headers included,
and how users can get to those, via `config=verbose()` call (#124)
* Better failure modes on input parameters, still more work to do
surely (#101)
* sleeping now between tests to avoid making crossref rate
limit gate keepers mad (#125)
* `cr_search` and `cr_search_free` are now defunct. They were marked
deprecated in previous version, and warned of defunct, and now
they are defunct. Similar functionality can be done with e.g., `cr_works()`
(#102)
* `crosscite` is now defunct. The functionality of this function can be
achieved with `cr_cn()` (#82)
* `cr_fundref` is now defunct. Crossref changed their name `fundref`
to `funders`, so we've changed our function, see `cr_funders()` (#83)
* parameter `sample` maximum value is now 100, was previously 1000.
documentation updated. (#118)
* New filters `has-clinical-trial-number` and `has-abstract` added to
the package, see `?filters` for help (#120)



rcrossref 0.5.8
===============

### NEW FEATURES

* Added an RStudio Addin for searching for citations. See `?rcrossref` for
more. Addin authored by Hao Zhu @haozhu233 (#114)
* New function `cr_abstract()` that tries to get an abstract via XML provided by
Crossref - NOTE: an abstract is rarely available though (#116)

### BUG FIXES

* Fixed bug in `cr_cn()` where DOIs with no minting agency found were
failing because we were previously stopping when no agency found.
Now, we just assume Crossref and move on from there. (#117)
thanks @dfalster !
* Fix to `cr_r()` when number requested > 100. Actual fix is in
`cr_works()`. Max for sample used to be 1000, asked this on the
Crossref API forum,
see <https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc/issues/146> (#115)
* Fix to `cr_journals()` in internal parsing, was failing in cases
where `ISSN` array was of length zero

rcrossref 0.5.4
===============

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* Improved documentation for `cr_citation_count()` to remove PLOS
reference as the function isn't only for PLOS works (#108)
* Changed use of `dplyr::rbind_all()` to `dplyr::bind_rows()` (#113)

rcrossref 0.5.2
===============

### NEW FEATURES

* User-agent string is passed with every request to Crossref with
names and versions of this package, and its HTTP dependency packages: `httr`
and `curl` (which `httr` depends on). Will potentially be useful to
Crossref to know how many requests come from this R client (#100)

### DEPRECATED

* `cr_search()` and `cr_search_free()` use old Crossref web services, so
are now marked deprecated, and will throw a deprecation message, but can
still be used. They will both be defunct in `v0.6` of this package (#99)

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* `XML` replaced with `xml2` (#98)
* `httr::content()` calls: all parse to text then parse content
manually. in addition, encoding explicitly set to `UTF-8` on
`httr::content()` calls (#98)

### BUG FIXES

* Bug fix to `cr_journals()` - fix to parse correctly on some failed requests
(#97) thanks @nkorf
* Bug fix to `cr_fundref()/cr_funders()` - parsing wasn't working correctly in
all cases

rcrossref 0.5.0
===============

Skipped `v0.4` to `v0.5` because of many changes - as described below.

### NEW FEATURES

* Support added for 'deep paging' with the newer Crossref search API. Two new params added to each function: `cursor`, which accepts a cursor alphanumeric string or the special `*`, which indicates that you want to initiate deep paging; `cursor_max`, which is not in the Crossref API, but just used here in this package to indicate where to stop - otherwise, you'd get all results, even if there was 70 million, for example. A new internal `R6` class used to make cursor requests easy (#77)
* New function `id_converter()` to get a PMID from a DOI and vice versa (#49)
* Added a Code of Conduct.
* New function `cr_types()`, along with its low level equivalent `cr_types_()` for when you just want a list or json back (#92)
* New suite of functions composing a low-level API for the Crossref search API. These functions only do data request, and return json or a list, and do not attempt to parse to a data.frame. The new functions: `cr_funders_()`, `cr_journals_()`, `cr_licenses_()`, `cr_members_()`, `cr_prefixes_()`, `cr_types_()`, `cr_works_()`. These functions are a bit faster, and aren't subject to parsing errors in the event of a change in the Crossref API. (#93)
* Added new `filter_names()` and `filter_details()` functions to get information on what filters
are available, the expected values, and what they mean.

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* Added documentation for new filter types, and added them to list of filters for `filter_names()` and `filter_details()` (#73)
* `cr_funders()` alias added to `cr_fundref()` (#74)
* Made note in docs that funders without IDs don't show up on the `/funders` route,s in `cr_funders()` (#79)
* Made note in docs that `sample` parameter ignored unless `works=TRUE` (#81)
* Added note to docs that only what is returned in the API is what is searched when you search the Crossref API - that is, abstracts and full text aren't searched (#91)
* `cr_cn()` now checks that the user supplied content-type is supported for the DOI minting agency associated with the DOI (#88) (thanks @njahn82)
* Removed `.progress` parameter use internally where it wasn't applicable.
* `sample` parameter dropped from `cr_licenses()`.
* `cr_works()` parsing changed. We now don't attempt to flatten nested arrays, but instead give them back as data.frame's nested within the main data.frame. For example, `author` often has many entries, so we return that as a single column, but indexing to that column gives back a data.frame with a row for each author, and N number of columns. Hopefully this doesn't break too much code downstream :)
* Additional text added to the package level man file (`?rcrossref`) to explain: what you're actually searching when you search; deprecated and defunct functions; and explanation of high vs. low level API.

### BUG FIXES

* Fix to `cr_members()` to warn on error instead of stop during parsing (#68)
* Fix to internal parser for `cr_works()` to output links data, for full text links (#70)
* Minor fix in `cr_cn()` example that didn't work (#80)
* Fixed parsing of `affiliation` data inside `author` object in Crossref search API returned data (#84)
* Fixed parsing of funder `award` slot in Crossref search API returned data (#90)

### DEPRECATED

* `crosscite()` deprecated, will be removed in a future version of this package (#78)
* `cr_fundref()` now has a deprecated message, and will be removed in the next version (#74)

rcrossref 0.3.4
===============

### NEW FEATURES

* Added new function `crosscite()` to work with the
Citeproc service (http://crosscite.org/citeproc/) (#60)

### BUG FIXES

* Fixed problems related to `httr` `v1` (#65)
* Import all non-base R functions (#64)
* The agency route was down used by the `cr_agency()` function,
back up and fixed now (#63)

rcrossref 0.3.0
===============

### NEW FEATURES

* New function `extract_pdf()` to extract text from pdfs
* New function `cr_ft_links()` to get links for full text content of an article (#10)
* New function `cr_ft_text()` to get links for full text content of an article. In addition,
`cr_ft_pdf()`, `cr_ft_plain()`, and `cr_ft_xml()` are convenience functions that will get
the format pdf, plain text, or xml, respectively. You can of course specify format in the
`cr_ft_text()` function with the `type` parameter (#10) (#42)

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* Filled out more tests (#45)

### BUG FIXES

* No longer assign queried doi to the `data.frame` in `cr_works()`, which caused failure if
a non-Crossref DOI included (#52)
* `pmid2doi()` and `doi2pmid()` functions removed temporarily as the web service is down
temporarily, but will be online again soon from Crossref (#48)

rcrossref 0.2.1
===============

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* Fixes for man file examples. (#35)
* `cr_citation()` is deprecated (stil useable, but will be removed in a
future version of the package). use `cr_cn()` instead. (#34)

rcrossref 0.2.0
===============

### NEW FEATURES

* released to CRAN
